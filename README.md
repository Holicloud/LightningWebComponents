# Lightning Component Library

## Component Reference

The Component Reference is where you find the details about each base Lightning component. It documents the full set of base components for both the Lightning Web Components and Aura programming models.

Here are a few highlights about the Component Reference.

### Filter components

On the Overview page, filter to focus on the components you’re interested in. For example, to see only those components related to navigation, select **Filters | Categories | Navigation**.

### View targets

When you select a component, the Target panel at the top shows where you can use the component. Targets can include Salesforce App, Lightning Experience, Experience Builder Sites, Salesforce Mobile App, Standalone Lightning App, and so on.

### View example, documentation, and specification pages

Most components have **Example** and **Documentation** pages.

The Component Reference doesn’t display documentation for your custom Lightning web components.

Some attributes that have default values don't display a value in the Default column. See the Description column for default values.
Custom events aren’t displayed in Specification pages. See the component’s Documentation page for this information.

## Component Reference Examples

The **Examples** tab shows base Lightning component sample code that renders in a runtime environment on the page.
